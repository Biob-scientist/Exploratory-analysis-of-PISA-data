## Overview
***
>PISA is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. The survey examined how well students have learned the school curriculum and how well prepared they were for life beyond school in 2012. Beginning from the variables selection to the exploratory phase of the analysis, the goal was to identify factors at home and in school that influences children's (15- 16 years) performance.

## Dataset
***
>The PISA dataset contains information on 485,490 students described with 636 variables. The dataset has a wealth of information about the family, school, students' personality and many other information surrounding students in their end of compulsory education year. The dataset can be found on [Udacity servers](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisa2012.csv.zip&sa=D&ust=1581581520574000), and a detailed explanation of all its features can be obtained from this [spreadsheet](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud507/pisadict2012.csv&sa=D&ust=1554482573645000).

## Preliminary Data Wrangling
***
>Out of the 636 attributes in the  dataset, only 41 were selected and Of the 41, new attributes were formed by merging 2 or more columns together thereby reducing the number to 16 columns after data cleaning. All null records were deleted because the left over size was sufficient to achieve a 99% confidence level and accommodate a 1% margin of error. All columns were transformed appropriately and the entries of some columns were coded for brevity.

## Summary of Findings
***
> The result of the exploratory analysis is largely intuitive. However, it also yields a striking outcome that deviates from the norm.

> It was gathered from the analysis that home support and availability of study materials to students are key ingredients to success. Six specific academic materials were looked at which are: literature, poetry, art, textbooks, technical textbooks, and dictionary. Ownership of one or more of these materials was found to positively correlate with the performance of students. In addition, it was noted that the combined effect of home support and ownership of the 6 books types has a magical effect on the overall success of students.

>Truancy is another key observation that was made that hampers students' performance. It was discovered that an increased rate of truancy correlated negatively with student success. However, it was difficult to conclude that students in this category underperformed because they skipped classes given the fact that truants displayed a high sense of competition when grouped with students that suffer the same fate- no home support and study materials.

> While simulation hinders students' performance, occasional group work seems to work better for the students from a general perspective. On the other hand, it was interesting to find out that frequent simulation and group work best for chronic truants.
